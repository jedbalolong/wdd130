            <p>Hello, I'm Jed Balolong, from the Philippines. I belong to a big family and the youngest among the siblings. My recreational pursuits include engaging in strategic games such as chess and table tennis. I find great satisfaction from outdoor activities and enjoy spending time with my cats.
            <br><br>
            I aspire to become an artist and I want to explore its various facets and diverse artistic expressions. Additionally, I am keenly interested in the field of computer technology. My passions in arts and computer drive me to become a multimedia/ visual designer. At present, I work as a multimedia design specialist. </p>

            <p>Located in the Pacific Ocean near the equator, the Republic of the Philippines consists of around 7,640 islands â€” about 2,000 of which are inhabited â€” that form an archipelago. The country can be divided into three main areas: Luzon (the largest, northernmost island, which includes Manila); a group of islands called the Visayas (including the major islands Panay, Negros, Cebu, Bohol, Leyte, Samar, and Masbate); and Mindanao, the second-largest island in the Philippines, found at the southern end of the archipelago.
